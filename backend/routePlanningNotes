Inspectors:
  Get:
    -> Inspectors positions
    => Websocket feed updating with inspectors updates
Vehicles:
  Get:
    -> vehicles_positions
    -> closest_vehicle // vehicle that user is most probably in based on users coordinates
    -> routeID
    => Websocket updating vehicle position every ztm update



The PLAN:

What do i want to do? -> An app where users can report and check the positions of tiket inspectors.

1. Report ticket insprectors position.
  -> position of user
  -> calculate the most probable vehicle the user and ticket inspector are on
  -> ask user if the data is correct 
  -> send to http server and save data (vehivle, inspector probability)
